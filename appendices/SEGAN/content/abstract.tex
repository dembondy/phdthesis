Traditional sources for ancillary services are diminishing as intermittent distributed renewable energy sources supplant traditional fossil-fueled generation units. Aggregation of large quantities of consumption units is expected to be a new source of energy services, including power system ancillary services.
While the performance capabilities of fossil-fueled generation units is well understood, the performance assessment of aggregation algorithms needs to be analysed. Furthermore, ancillary services need to be modeled such that aggregated services can be verified.
This paper presents a novel modeling method for ancillary services. The service models are useful for assessing the performance of aggregators. The paper also presents performance and verification indices for aggregator service provision.
The use of the modeling method and the indices are exemplified in three case studies.
These concepts are critical if aggregators are to help ensure the security of the power grid in a future with high amount of intermittent power generation.
