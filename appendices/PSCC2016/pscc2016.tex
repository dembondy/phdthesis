\textbf{Abstract:}\\
As aggregators become viable sources of ancillary services, they will be required to undergo a validation process similar to the prequalification process of traditional generators. Since aggregators are fundamentally different from traditional generators, a new test method must be designed for the aggregator validation. This work proposes a method for designing the tests necessary for the validation process. The method is exemplified with a study case and results are presented.
