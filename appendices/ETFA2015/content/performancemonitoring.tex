%\subsection{Performance Monitoring}
\textbf{B. Performance Monitoring}
The performance monitoring function collects data from which the behaviour of individual clients can be derived. The data is analyzed to determine the performance of a client, and its compliance with the contracted flexibility service. This analysis may be internal to the performance monitoring function, or it may simply serve as a data gatherer for an external entity.
