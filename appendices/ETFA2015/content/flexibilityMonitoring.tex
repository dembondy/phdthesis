%\subsection{Flexibility Monitoring}
\textbf{F. Flexibility Monitoring}
In operation, the aggregator must assess the future flexibility of its portfolio in real time; this includes individual DER flexibility as well as the aggregated flexibility of the portfolio. The flexibility assessment can either be based on direct feedback from the DERs or entirely on estimation models (possibly stochastic) if direct feedback is not available.
