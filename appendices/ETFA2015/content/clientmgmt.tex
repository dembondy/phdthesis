%\subsection{Client management}
\textbf{H. Client management}
The client management function actively or passively tracks the availability of clients. It may also provide a mechanism for the dynamic addition and removal of clients, such as a discovery service, and maintain a protocol for temporarily disabling otherwise available resources. It contributes to resilience and graceful degradation of the portfolio.
