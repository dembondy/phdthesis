%\subsection{Service Interface}
\textbf{A. Service Interface}
The service interface translates the contractual agreements between the aggregator and its clients into a service model containing quantifiable and measurable service requirements and a set of performance criteria. This service model is then used to map incoming service requests to control domain signals such as control variables, constraints or control parameters.
