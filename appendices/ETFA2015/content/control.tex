\textbf{E. Control}
The control function is in charge of generating the appropriate control domain signals for the portfolio. Depending on the control architecture, the control logic may be distributed between physical entities. The concept of a control domain signal covers several kinds of signals, including, but not limited to control inputs to DERs, coordination messages for distributed control and reference signals for hierarchical controllers.
