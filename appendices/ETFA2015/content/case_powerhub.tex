\subsection{Power Hub}
PowerHub is an aggregator developed by Dong Energy in Denmark. It is controlling distributed generation and load in order to sell flexibility services to the ancillary power market.
(Figure~\ref{fig:powerhub}).
\subsubsection{Service interpretation}
Power Hub utilizes manual integration of DERs primarily based on a standardized contract in which a parameter representing the flexible demand is specified together with potential constraints. These values are defined by the DER owner together with a Power Hub consultant and entered into Power Hub as static constraints for the optimization module.

\subsubsection{Operator interface}
Power Hub provides operator interfaces for Power Hub operators, the Balancing Responsible and the Danish TSO. Power Hub also provides a user interface to DER owners.

\subsubsection{Information services}
Power Hub utilizes several information services, ...   

\subsubsection{Knowledge exchange}
Power Hub utilizes persistence to continuously store the state of its portfolio DERs.

\subsubsection{Internal aggregator communication}

\subsubsection{Control}
An optimization algorithm receives the static constraints as given in the DER contracts as well as dynamic constraints given by the DER owner through the owner.
