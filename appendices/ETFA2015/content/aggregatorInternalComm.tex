%\subsection{Aggregator-internal communication}
\textbf{G. Aggregator-internal communication}
Except for very few special cases, aggregation will almost always be implemented as a distributed computing system. In its basic form, such a system would consist of one aggregator and a number of clients. This may be extended by stacking multiple levels of aggregation etc. The internal communication function exchanges information between aggregator and clients.
