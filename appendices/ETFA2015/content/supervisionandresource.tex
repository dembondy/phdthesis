\textbf{C. Supervision and Resource Handling}
The aggregator must maintain an overview of available client resources and their status. By comparing the communication status and monitored performance of individual clients to the control signals sent by the aggregator, the supervision function determines whether clients perform according to their contract. It may temporarily or permanently exclude non-compliant clients from the pool of available resources.
