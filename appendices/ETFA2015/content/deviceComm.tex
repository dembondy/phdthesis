\textbf{J. Asset interface}
Most aggregators in a Smart Grid context will be used to harvest flexibility from existing energy resources. In most cases communication between aggregator and resource will use a fieldbus-style interface not designed for wide-area communication. The purpose of the asset interface is to maintain communication with a physical unit under aggregator control and provide abstraction from interface details.
