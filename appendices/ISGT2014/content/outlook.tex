	The index is useful for the systematic evaluation of the adequacy of different control architectures providing ancillary services. As modelled in this paper, the index only gives a general idea of the performance of the control algorithm, but future work could include a method for differentiating the sources of high error. It is also expected that the performance index can be used for validating Aggregators for ancillary service provision. 
	
	In order to do a successful evaluation of an aggregation algorithm, it is important that the QoS specifications of the future ancillary services are well defined. This is a challenge in itself since many of the ancillary services assume a production baseline, which is easy to establish in traditional generators, but proves to be difficult for small households (see e.g. \cite{Borenstein}).
 The evaluation of aggregation control algorithms is an important part of a general validation framework for Aggregators. Future work will include performance assessment in laboratory implementation, where it is expected that different sources of error will yield values of $\eta$ closer to 1.
