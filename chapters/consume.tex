As stated before that the danish government expects a 50\% wind energy penetration in the power system by year 2020. In the traditional power system, the uncertainty in consumption causes imbalances. With the increase of wind energy generation, the uncertainty in production also causes imbalances. This means that TSOs must find new ways of balancing the system. Also, new problems will appear at the distribution system level, such as power congestion and voltage issues. These problems are due to new kinds of consumption units appearing in the system, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and heat pumps (HPs), and due to new generation units, e.g. wind turbines (WT), small size combined heat and power generators (micro-CHPs) and photovoltaic (PV) cells, installed at distribution level. All these new units in the electric power system are commonly referred to as Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). It is the responsibility of the Distribution System Operator (DSO) to resolve the problems arising due to the integration of the DERs, which can be overloading of system components or voltage issues. These problems affect the quality of the power supply at residential level.

The expected future smart grid can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:powerfuture} where the orange field denotes Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) integration, the dark green field denotes small size traditional generators, the light green denotes renewable generation, the olive green denotes storage, and the yellow field denotes units capable of changing their consumption according to an incentive.

Compared to the current market setup, the Aggregator entity has been added, as well as the ability of DSOs to contract ancillary services. Also, the consumer becomes a player in the electricity markets through the Aggregator.}\label{fig:marketfuture}
\end{figure*}

In order to cope with the new problems, both at transmission and distribution level, it is expected that consumers will become prosumers. That is, the consumers will take an active role in the power markets by selling services to the system operators through an Aggregator. The Aggregator will provide an asset management service to the end consumer, and by doing this for a large amount of consumers, it will be able to control a large enough consumption volume to provide ancillary services to the System Operators. The action of a consumer changing his or her consumption based upon an incentive is known as Demand Response (DR), and the Aggregator facilitates DR through control services. The Aggregator can be an independent commercial entity, or it can be a function inside one of the pre-existing market players. The new market setup can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:marketfuture}, and it shows how the Aggregator player will interact with the existing market setup, and how the DSO will become a new player in the market, which will acquire ancillary services to resolve some of it problems.

In conclusion, we see the electric power system moving away from a \emph{production-must-follow-consumption} pattern to \emph{consumption-should-partly-follow-consumption} and hereby facilitate the integration of renewables and DERs. An integral part of achieving this change will be the use of control services to change the consumption behavior of units in the network.
