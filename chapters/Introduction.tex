\chapter{Introduction}
What is meant with control services? In european context it is very much focused on Ancillary Services, while in the US Demand Response has not been used very much as AS, but rather used by ISOs as a mechanic to cope with peak consumption, or in the wholesale market. In the US context it would not make sense to call the upward service for the aggregator an ancillary service. Maybe aggregator business case?

Three kinds of stability: rotor angle, frequency stability and voltage stability[maybe cite kundur here?]. This work focuses on frequency stability, although there has been done some brief work on voltage issues in Xue's paper.

``futures necessarily be- long to the present: they are what we imagine for ourselves now. The present is itself only made visible against a past''[cite: Marilyn Strathern, 1992]

Product Delivery: Performance Measurement 
Performance measurement, which is typically termed Measurement and Verification (M\&V), is the process of quantifying and validating the provision of the service according to the specifications of product. The performance measurement process usually occurs at three stages: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item To qualify potential resources against product specifications as an entry gate to participation 
	\item To verify resource conformance to the product specifications during and after participation 
	\item To calculate the amount of product delivered by the resource as part of financial settlements
\end{itemize}
 
All resources should be held to the performance specifications established by the product. However â€“ demand side and generation side communication requirements will usually need to be designed separately and made appropriate to each. Technical rules often proscribe the use of metered values to base performance and settlements.[from the SEDC report used in the DRAS paper]
