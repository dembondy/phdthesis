\chapter{Introduction}
\newchapter{R}{esearch has shown} that climate change is a fact and that, with a 95\% certainty, human activity is the main cause for global warming \fcite{ipcc2013climate}. As a way to mitigate the increasing rate of climate change, the Danish government has set as an interim goal to reduce the national $CO_2$ emissions by 40\% in 2020, in order to reach the target of 80\% - 95\% reduction by 2050\fcite{regeringen2013danish}. This is to be done by covering 50\% of the national electricity consumption with wind energy by 2020, fully covering the electricity and heating supply with renewable energy by 2035, and being completely fossil fuel independent by 2050. Investing in an intelligent and flexible power system is deemed to be important if we are to reach those goals\fcite{regeringen2013smart}.

Although the government changed in 2015 and the financial support to environmentally friendly initiatives was significantly reduced, we still consider the previously established goals worth pursuing, as explained in Section~\ref{sec:justification}. In order to integrate the wind generated energy into the power system, the power system must change as described in Section~\ref{sec:powsysdesc}. In Section~\ref{sec:funneling} challenges are identified within this new power system framework, and this work's contributions to solve said challenges are summarized.
%adopted by the Danish government, a large part of Danish research has been focused on how to integrate renewable energy sources, as well as new distributed energy resources, into the power system. The world energy sector is experiencing drastic changes due to environmental, health and security issues.

\label{sec:justification}
\newsection{E}{nergy is a pillar} in the development of all countries. The access to energy is a necessity that traditionally is supplied by fossil fuels, but the use of fossil fuels carries consequences that have impacted nature and society in three different ways:
\begin{description}
	\item[Climate issues:] Reports like the Stern Review\fcite{stern2006stern} have made it abundantly clear that global warming and climate change will have considerable negative impact on society. If the current trend continues, global temperatures will rise 2-3 $^\circ$C within the next fifty years, but this number will increase by several degrees if emissions continue to grow. The consequences of global warming will impact society mainly through issues related to water:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item melting glaciers will increase flood risk and reduce water supplies
			\item declining crop yields
			\item rising sea levels will result in increased floods, as well as the disappearance of coastal regions and islands\footnote{According to one estimate, up to 200 million people may become permanently displaced due to these effects by mid-century\cite{stern2006stern}.}
			\item changes in ecosystems may lead to the extinction of 15 - 40\% of species, and the acidification of oceans may lead to decline in fish stocks
		\end{itemize}
	\item[Health issues:] Air pollutants resulting from the use of fossil fuel for transportation and electricity generation has been shown to be responsible for large numbers of morbidity and mortality. For example, in a study focused on traffic-related air pollution on public health in Austria, France and Switzerland\fcite{kunzli2000public}, it is found that in these three countries air pollution is directly attributable to:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 6\% of total mortality (40 000 cases)
			\item 25 000 new cases of chronic bronchitis in adults
			\item more than 290 000 episodes of bronchitis in children
			\item more that 0.5 million asthma attacks
			\item more than 16 million person-days of restricted activities.
		\end{itemize} 
		Other sources\fcite{lelieveld2015a,who2014fact} estimate that air pollution leads to 3.3 - 3.7 million premature deaths per year, with the majority of the deaths occurring in Asia.
		Furthermore, climate change will have a direct impact on health through:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item increased frequency of and intensity of heat waves
			\item changes in distribution of vector-borne diseases
			\item increased floods and droughts\fcite{haines2006climate}
		\end{itemize}
	\item[Geo-political issues:] The concept of energy security has changed from being a local issue to include new concepts with respect to the provision of energy services. While traditionally it was a simple question of supply, measured by the four As of energy security (availability, affordability, accessibility and acceptability), it now encompasses concepts as efficiency, environmentally benign, properly governed and socially acceptable energy services\fcite{pasqualetti2012importance}. Also, governments around the world are taking steps to mitigate their vulnerability in energy supply, increasing the importance of sustainable energy generation. 
\end{description}

In the work by \textit{Cherp \& Jewel}\fcite{cherp2014concept}, the authors make a compelling argument for a new method for addressing the concept of \emph{energy security} by treating it as a case of general security. Thus, \emph{energy security} must address the questions: 1) \emph{Security for whom?}; 2) \emph{Security for which values}; and, 3) \emph{Security from what threats?}. Following the Danish government's climate policy plan and the goals of Energinet.dk\sidenote{Energinet.dk is the Danish Transmission System Operator, the entity responsible of maintaining a secure transmission power grid.}, these three question can be answered in a Danish context as:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \emph{Energy security} in Denmark means that the population and industry should have an \emph{adequate} and \emph{secure}\sidenote{\emph{System adequacy} refers to the power system's ability to supply electricity demand at all times and \emph{system security} refers to the ability to withstand sudden disturbances \cite{entsoe2014glossary}.} power system.
	\item Given the previously cited climate policy plan, it is safe to assume that sustainability is the major value in what concerns \emph{energy security}.
	\item All the threats to \emph{energy security} can not be outlined here, but they include concepts of resilience and vulnerabilities. An example of a new vulnerability is the dependence on intermittent energy sources.
\end{enumerate}

In short, in order for the government to secure the future of the population against climate change, while ensuring that Denmark remains economically competitive through the research and export of green technologies, it is essential that a transition to a sustainable\fcite{brundtland1987our} energy system is achieved. 

This thesis addresses one of the solutions proposed to deal with the vulnerability introduced by the increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources in the grid, as well as the increased stress on the power system due to the electrification of the transport and heating sectors. The following section explains the changes that the grid experiences as a consequence of the transition to a sustainable power system.

\section{Changes in the power system}% (fold)
\label{sec:powsysdesc}
\newsection{I}{n order to understand} the relevance of this research project, it is important to define how the power system is expected to change, and clarify the frame for the research. This section gives a general introduction\footnote{In-depth explanations will be presented as needed in subsequent chapters.} to the changes expected in the power system. The main actors in the power system and their relationships (from a Danish perspective) are presented, which will help scoping the problem.%\marginnote{This section is based on an unpublished paper written for the course 31920, Communicating Advanced topics in Electrical Engineering.}

\section{Problem statement, Delimitation and Contributions} % (fold)
\label{sec:funneling}
\newsection{A}{ggregators are expected to} be new providers of ancillary services, and other energy related services, to the players in the power markets. This means that they must go through the same prequalification/certification process that current providers of ancillary services must go through. Therefore, as stated in the previous section, the control algorithms and architecture that form an aggregator must be validated\marginnote{The Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) defines validation as: ``The assurance that a product, service, or system meets the needs of the customer and other identified stakeholders.''}. Several factors, such as the distributed nature and the modular composition of aggregators, make this problem non-trivial. The overarching question this thesis seeks to answer is: \emph{How can aggregators be validated, such that they can be trusted by the power market participants, and hereby actively help with the secure operation of the power system?}.
%control-services? This is a broad definition, and here I will  narrow down my research to use control services to provide ancillary services, primarily through demand response, but the techniques should be able to be generalized.

In order to delimit the scope of the problem, certain decisions with regards to the research were made.
\begin{itemize}
	\item In terms of the services considered, only those related to active power were analysed. The topic of voltage related services was touched upon as a collaboration with \emph{X. Han}\fcite{han2014assessment}, but does not form part of the core of the presented research.
	\item The power system setup is assumed to be a liberalized market, such as the one in Denmark. Although some of the work is translatable to other countries, e.g. the United States, the focus has been on solutions suited to the Nordic region.
	\item Focus has been given to the development of concepts rather than software implementation. Still, a module for service verification was developed for the laboratory.
\end{itemize}

The original contributions to the field of aggregator validation are:
\begin{description}
	\item[Aggregator reference architecture:] In order to evaluate an aggregator, it must first be clear what is the role and the expected functioning of the aggregator. Chapter~\ref{cha:aggregator} presents a reference architecture for aggregators, which has the purpose of:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item defining a standard lexicon around the aggregator, and
			\item identifying the required functionality necessary for the effective working of an aggregator.
		\end{enumerate}
		This contribution is important for aggregator validation since it harmonizes the concept aggregator concept, and can be used directly for documentation purposes of the aggregator capabilities as part of the prequalification process\footnote{ The reference architecture can also be used as aggregator design guidelines for new players entering the market.}. 
	\item[Aggregator validation procedure:] Chapter~\ref{cha:validation} presents a framework for aggregator validation testing, as well as the outline of a procedure for validation tests. Specifically, statistical concepts are used for defining the validation requirements and performance measures. This contribution is important because the usual validation tests applied to generators can not be applied to the (fundamentally) different aggregators, and this procedure takes these differences into account.
	\item[Definition and modeling of services:] Currently, the requirement definitions for ancillary services assume that the services will be provided by traditional units. In Chapter~\ref{cha:services} a novel approach to ancillary service definitions in terms of performance is presented. Furthermore, a new method for building service models that are useful for the performance assessment of service delivery is presented. The new ancillary service definition is necessary for effectively integrating aggregators, and other new technologies, into the power system as new sources of ancillary services. The method for service modeling provides the service models required for calculating performance assessment of aggregators, or other service providing technologies.
	\item[Aggregator performance assessment:] In order to verify if an aggregator delivered a service according to its service contract, the performance of the aggregator must be assessed. In Chapter~\ref{cha:verification} a set of indices for performance assessment and service delivery are presented. These indices are general measures for service delivery and are novel in the way that they are not defined for specific services, but are applied to interchangeable service models.
\end{description}

Each chapter contains the relevant state-of-the-art analysis to that topic and corresponding sub-conclusions. The thesis focuses on the theoretical concepts presented in the publications, but most of these concepts have been illustrated through cases studies in the articles. These case studies are not presented within the body of the thesis, but the reader can refer to the relevant articles in the appendices for said case studies. Overall conclusions and perspectives on future work are presented in Chapter~\ref{cha:conclusion}, and the relevant articles forming the research content of the thesis are found as appendices. 
%What is meant with control services? In european context it is very much focused on Ancillary Services, while in the US Demand Response has not been used very much as AS, but rather used by ISOs as a mechanic to cope with peak consumption, or in the wholesale market. In the US context it would not make sense to call the upward service for the aggregator an ancillary service. Maybe aggregator business case?
