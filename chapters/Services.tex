\chapter{Services Requirements for Aggregators} % (fold)
\label{cha:services}
Content of this chapter is the work done at LBNL and through the iPower demo.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Service definition
	\item What are aggregators expected to deliver?
	\item PowerMax service requirements
	\item Redefining Ancillary Services Requirements for Technology Agnostic Resources
\end{itemize}

Aggregators/DR provide flexibility, as it is, they are not being paid for flexibility as defined previously, but only for power. This needs rethinking.
