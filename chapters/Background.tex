\section{Short introduction to the power system now and in the future} % (fold)
\label{sec:powsysdesc}
This section is partially based on the technical report Operational Scenario: the manual regulating power market, as well as the popular science paper presented for the course Communicating Advanced topics in Electrical Engineering.

\subsection{The traditional power system} % (fold)
\label{sub:tradpowdesc}

This section is intended for readers who are not already familiar with the power system. Will clarify basic concepts like production/consumption balance, system frequency, System Operators, Energy markets, etc.
% subsection The traditional power system (end)

\subsection{The new flexible power system} % (fold)
\label{sub:newpowdesc}
Talk about how we see the changes coming to the power system, and how the aggregator will be a new player, and the DSO will become an active player, as well as going from a consumer paradigm to a prosumer paradigm.
% subsection The new flexible power system (end)

\section{Funneling} % (fold)
\label{sec:Funneling}
What is meant by control-services? This is a broad definition, and here I will  narrow down my research to use control services to provide ancillary services, primarily through demand response, but the techniques should be able to be generalized.

Scoping of the PhD, and what the rest of the thesis will contain.
