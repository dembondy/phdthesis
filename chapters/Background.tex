	\section{Aggregator Design and Evaluation}\label{sec:aggeval}
	The performance evaluation of aggregators is one of the main concerns of this thesis. \marginnote{In order to put in perspective the contribution presented in this thesis, it is necessary to discuss the state of the art of the topics of the research. This chapter presents a short discussion on the state of the art of concerning aggregator evaluation in Section~\ref{sec:aggeval}, ancillary services requirements in Section~\ref{sec:ancser} and Demand Response in Section~\ref{sec:demres}.}
	The literature focusing on aggregators has grown in recent years, and many different architectures have been proposed, trying to solve different problems in the power system. Examples of this are \ldots\todo{fill out with relevant papers, including dmpc paper}. An overview of the classification of aggregators can be found in \todo{paper by Anna}, which divides aggregation methodologies according to their control paradigm into direct, indirect, transactive and autonomous control.
	\section{Ancillary Services}\label{sec:ancser}
	\section{Demand Response}\label{sec:demres}
Here goes everything related to the ``literature study''. Focus will be on ancillary services and demand response. What are the barriers for DR in the current markets. Part of this section will come from the paper on Redefining Ancillary Services for Technology Agnostic Sources.
