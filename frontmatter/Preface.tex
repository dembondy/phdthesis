\chapter{Preface}
This thesis was prepared at the Energy Systems Operation and Management group under the Center for Electric Power and Energy, which is part of the department of Electrical Engineering at the Technical University of Denmark. The thesis is a requirement for acquiring the Ph.D. degree in engineering, and was funded by Innovation Fund Denmark through the Strategic Platform for Innovation and Research in Intelligent Power (iPower), the Programme for Energy Technology Development and Demonstration (EUDP) through PowerLabDK and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

The thesis deals with the validation of aggregator architectures designed to deliver services to the power system. The main focus has been to develop parts of a framework that will allow the testing and the evaluation of aggregator architectures.
This thesis draws upon concepts from different fields and is multidisciplinary in its approach, drawing on concepts from disciplines such as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Power systems engineering,
	\item Control engineering,
	\item Software engineering,
	\item Systems engineering,
	\item Energy policy and regulation.
\end{itemize}

The project was supervised by Senior Scientist Henrik W. Bindner, and co-supervised by Associated Professor Hans Henrik Niemann, and Assistant Professor Kai Heussen, all three from DTU Electrical Engineering. Part of the research was conducted at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory with S{\i}la K{\i}l{\i}\c{c}\c{c}ote as supervisor.

The thesis consist of a synthesis (along with adjustments and expansions) of the concepts presented in two journal papers and three conference papers written in the period 2012-2016.
