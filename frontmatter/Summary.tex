\chapter{Summary}

[Raw study plan extract]

This PhD project is a combination of practical experience with state-of-the-art communication and automation technology with highly relevant theoretical challenges in automation of future electricity grids. Control-as-a-service is a new concept, which addresses the needs of a more flexible IT-based control infrastructure. It is a part of this PhD to further develop this concept, and therein, building on control competences, to develop assessment and validation strategies.
