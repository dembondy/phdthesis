\chapter{Acknowledgements}
I started the work on my PhD project in autumn 2012, and through these 3+ years I have collaborated with many inspiring people, too many to mention all of them here. I am thankful to my colleagues at DTU for being a source of inspiration, especially my colleagues at ESOM, with whom I have shared ideas, discussed, worked, travelled and shared friendship with.

I want to thank Emre C. Kara, Jason MacDonald and S{\i}la K{\i}l{\i}\c{c}\c{c}ote from LBNL (and now SLAC) for their great collaboration during my stay in Berkeley and for making me feel welcome in the Grid Integration Group. % Also, Lindsay Briar Madison provided proofreading and editing of the highest quality.

This thesis would not have been possible without the feedback and guidance of my supervisors, Henrik W. Bindner, Kai Heussen and Henrik Niemann. They have given me support in different, but complementary ways.

Last, but not least, I want to thank my friends and family for their support while working on this project: my girlfriend Cille has been patient and supportive in the last stages of the thesis writing, my father Isidro helped me understand my research in a geo-political context, and my mother Madeleine, apart from giving moral support, moved country and made it possible for me to do my external stay.

To my daughter Sofia, who shows me that playing is just as important as studying.
